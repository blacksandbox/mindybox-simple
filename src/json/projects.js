  							I made this project to teach myself Django and React. Started out as a Trello imitation but slowly found its purpose as an animation editor that creates an experimental form of media called "flipbook" (name subject to change).
  							<br/>
  							Flipbooks are intended to create something that appear scenamatic, but is low cost since it is not an actual movie. 
  							<br/>
							The app is still at its infancy. More features will be added.
